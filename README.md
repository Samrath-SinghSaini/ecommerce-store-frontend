# Electronic Retail Ecommerce Web Application 

## Description
Frontend code for an Ecommerce store application selling electronic products. This project is written in React and interacts with the backend API I created in NodeJS. 
I know the name is too template-y and boring, I am in the process of thinking of a name. Stay tuned for that.
